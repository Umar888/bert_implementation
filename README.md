# bert_implementation
In this code, I implemented BERT model using a single sentence as an input
Here Model Construction is the main file
Pediction file just used the saved model and make prediction if we give sentences as an input
You can change the path of data in model construstion file. My dataset has 4 output classes

Related work => 0
Comparison => 1
Using the work => 2
Extending the work => 3

Each class has been assigned a numerical number
You can see "Follow-up" in dataset in my output column
I am taking "Tagged Sentences" as input sentence in BERT model
Now I want to add more features in my dataset and include those feautres in BERT model
